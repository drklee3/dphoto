# dphoto

uhh wip + need a new name ðŸ¤”

## Requirements

* Rust version 1.39+ (for async/await)
* PostgreSQL
* `libpq-dev`

## Building

```bash
# Install Rust -- https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:drklee3/dphoto.git

# Or clone with HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/drklee3/dphoto.git

cd dphoto

# Build for release
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

Configuration for the database is stored in a `config.toml` file.  This file
should be created in the project root directory.  An example can be found in
[`config.example.toml`](https://github.com/drklee3/dphoto/blob/master/config.example.toml).

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml

# Then edit config.toml to match your database configuration
```

An annotated version of the example config is shown below.

```toml
[database]
# Full database url, other fields will be ignored if this is provided
url = "postgres://user:pass@host:port/db"

username = "drklee3"
password = "Hunter2"
host = "localhost"
# Port can be omitted to use the default 5432 port.  This should be used mainly if you're using a port other than 5432.
port = "5432"
name = "db name"
```

cargo run --release
